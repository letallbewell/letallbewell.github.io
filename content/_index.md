# About me

*Aspiring physicist, machine learning engineer in the past, loves it when physics meets computer science.*

{{% columns %}}

Due to the pandemic's constraints, I took a break from physics to spend some time in the industry. I worked with some of the challenging aspects of machine learning, particularly information retrieval from patents and learning from a few examples, catering to corporate customers.

In physics, I have worked in physical cosmology, quantum, and classical fluids, numerical methods, quantum computing, etc.

My present interests include tensor networks and renormalization group.
