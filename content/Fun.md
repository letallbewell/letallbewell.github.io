## Drawings

I have a penchant to draw in notebooks! A random collection from my old notebooks spanning many years. I am no Picasso but it relieves stress.

## Make and Fly Cheap RC Airplanes

{{% columns %}}

I am a massive fan of all flying things (lately disenchanted from jet engines due to environmental concerns), especially birds. It was my dream to imitate flight on a budget. I made an RC aircraft adhering to the bare minimum for sustained flight and control. I dare to call this one of the cheapest actively controlled flying structures; the cost is not far from the price of a brushless motor and Lithium-polymer battery. The control signals were transmitted using RF modules, not a reliable way to control the place, but as you guessed, it is ridiculously cheap.

## Make Chocolate from Scratch

Ferment raw cacao beans for a few weeks, dry in the sun, roast, remove nibs and grind. Your house will smell of chocolate, and you will be happy to be born on this planet.
