        <p>There is almost nothing in the world that I do not find interesting: Shakespeare, drawing, airplanes, computer science, the human body, physics and mathematics, you name it! I have tremendous respect for those who know what they want in life, yet I enjoy my fate with a passion even though sometimes I feel like I am paying for my breadth with depth. I chose physics because it has the most universal underpinnings, having to do something with everything. Yet I wholeheartedly recommend all children to be thoroughly educated in literature and history; science can give an infinite amount of facts, and its entirety does not help us to orient ourselves in the world and live a good life. It is better to resort to time-tested values of our culture (and not judge our ancestors whose battles we do not understand) unless we become superhumans who can invent their own values and live a good life (thank you, Nietzsche). I am a pragmatic physicist, learning as much and sometimes as little mathematics as required to describe nature, only talking about measurable quantities and not caring about interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p> 

        <p> Due to the pandemic's constraints, I took a break from physics to spend some time in the industry. I worked with some of the challenging aspects of machine learning, particularly information retrieval from patents and learning from a few examples, catering to corporate customers. I knew neural networks are magical from when I first heard of them in a 3blue1brown video, though deep learning is not deep enough compared to something like physics. The utility justifies exploration; the pursuit is similar to differential equations; both are trying to abstract out human intuition about the world in a computational form, though the latter can be made far more rigorous. Coming to Differential Equations(DEs), I attribute all my success in physics to my unwavering commitment to studying mathematics. But I hated DEs in university unless they came up in physics. Compared to the disjoint set of methods and examples as it is traditionally taught, it is the most geometric of all fields once you develop eyes for it. 
        </p>

        <p>I turned my life around after a difficult time in university, learned as much physics as I could, qualified as one of the top 100 in the highest tier graduate research scholarship in India, got into my country's best university for Ph.D. (the Indian Institute of Science), had a job that allowed me to support myself and others and help a lot of people and had my coveted full scholarship for MS at a US university. If it happened years back, any of these would have made my life, but we change when we stare into the abyss. Serendipitously, I read the introduction to Brian Cantwell's Introduction to Symmetry Methods at the time and learned about the details of the works of Sophus Lie and Emmy Noether. The anatomy of physics that I missed blew a hole in my heart and made me return, combined with the most stimulating atmosphere at the International Center for Theoretical Sciences, where I attended a fluid dynamics workshop. I am now working with Prof. Stephen Anco at Brock University in Canada for an MSc and enjoying learning DEs and relativity through the new geometric lens. 
          </p>

        <p> Human endeavor should be limitless; we are built to be spent. A great love is a flawed love. I feel full, and my adventure is plenty.</p>
