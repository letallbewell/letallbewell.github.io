      <description>Research Interests # In progress See the GitHub links for a bit more technical details. Tensor Networks, Renormalization, and Phase Transitions # [GitHub]
Tensor Networks are a new computational tool that finds applications in quantum many-body physics and machine learning. Among many of its applications, it allows for efficiently parametrizing high dimensional Hilbert spaces of quantum systems of interest and also provides a computationally tractable representation of partition functions involving lattice Hamiltonians (see Ising Model for an application to the Ising Hamiltonian using the Google&amp;rsquo;s Tensor Network library).</description>

      <description>Fun! # Drawings # I have a penchant to draw in notebooks! A random collection from my old notebooks spanning many years. I am no Picasso but it relieves stress.
Photos # Cool things I saw when I happened to have a phone.
Make and Fly Cheap RC Airplanes # I am a massive fan of all flying things (lately disenchanted from jet engines due to environmental concerns), especially birds.</description>
