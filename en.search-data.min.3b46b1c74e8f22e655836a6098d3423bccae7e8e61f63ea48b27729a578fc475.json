Cosmology # We would not be here if not for dark matter. Matter cannot aggregate gravitationally to form structures due to radiation pressure until the universe could cool down considerably. However, dark matter interacts gravitationally alone so that it could form bound structures and form gravitational potential buckets for matter to fall in later when the universe cooled down. Stars later lighted up the \u0026lsquo;dark\u0026rsquo; dark matter haloes!\nUnderstanding the nature of primordial fluctuations, the seed of all structures in the universe is a fundamental problem in modern physics. One tool to study this is the N-body simulation codes like the Gadget-II, which connects these fluctuations to present-day large-scale structure.\nFluid Dynamics # The Navier-Stokes equations (mass, momentum, and energy continuity. equations in fluids) can describe everything from stirring a cup of coffee to the earth\u0026rsquo;s climate. Predicting the fluid flow is challenging even with the complete knowledge of initial conditions. Most algorithms require massive parallelization, and there are many pesky numerical instabilities in simulations.\nFor my MSc thesis, I studied the driven lid cavity problem (think of a 2D box stirred from the top edge) using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). LBM is a numerical scheme stemming from kinetic theory using a discretized version of the Boltzmann equation with an ad-hoc collision operator defined to emulate fluid behavior. Since it only uses array movements and arithmetic operations, LBM is economical in the low Reynolds number regime where the LBM approximation is more faithful.\nQuantum Mechanics # Deriving the spectrum and the eigenvalues of the Hydrogen atom using the series solution to the Schrodinger equation is an analytical nightmare. The operator method (see section 6.2 of Principles of Quantum Mechanics, David Skinner) is also much work. I enjoyed both approaches, but you can use the finite difference approximation if you really need a feel of the solutions in no time.\nIn 1 dimension, the second derivative can be approximated as a difference, and the Schrodinger equation equates to a matrix eigenvalue problem after discretizing the potential. This formalism can easily be extended to 3d using tensor products, and voila, you have the answers!\nChaos in the Lorenz Attractor System # Patent Landscape Study of Quantum Technologies # In 2021, I wrote a patent landscape study report for Relecura Technologies, analyzing around 50k patents in quantum technologies using natural language processing tools. The report includes elementary physics explanations of the technologies aimed at policy makers and investors.\nReport Quantum Technologies: A Review of the Patent Landscape, Mathew Alex, 2021. # Taxonomy Taxonomy of the technologies (Interactive Version) # "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/resources/","title":"Resources","section":"Docs","content":" Resources # In progress\nLinks, my personal reviews, more resources, and my notes will be added soon.

It was my dream to imitate flight on a budget. I made an RC aircraft adhering to the bare minimum for sustained flight and control. I dare to call this one of the cheapest actively controlled flying structures; the cost is not far from the price of a brushless motor and Lithium-polymer battery. The control signals were transmitted using RF modules, not a reliable way to control the place, but as you guessed, it is ridiculously cheap.
